    "\n",
    "##### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The range() function in Python is used for generating a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form , it accepts an interger and returns a sequence of numbers starting from 0 upto the integer specified , not including the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its complete definition , it accepts three parameters as integers\n",
    "range (start,stop,step)\n",
    "- start (optional) - This is the first number of the sequence . Can be positive as well as negative\n",
    "- stop  (required) - This is the limit of the sequence.All numbers from start till this number before this will be included . This number will NOT be included.Can be positive as well as negative but should be greater than start , if start has been specified\n",
    "- step (optional) - The increment number of the sequence. By default it is 1. Cannot be a negative number\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example \n",
    "\n",
    "- range(5) would return 0,1,2,3,4\n",
    "\n",
    "- range(2,5) would return 2,3,4\n",
    "\n",
    "- range(2,10,2) would return 2,4,6,8\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "It is mainly used for code iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    \n",
